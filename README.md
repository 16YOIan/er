The answer lies in the nature of the firm actions which are compatible with the subgame perfect equilibrium. The level of $R \& D$ chosen by the domestic firm is the level which maximizes its profit within the confines of the behaviour which characterizes the two-stage Nash equilibrium. If a firm violates this equilibrium it risks the possibility it will earn lower profit in the unstable situation which follows. By providing a subsidy to firms, the government alters the perceived cost structure and thus changes the set of actions which are compatible with the two-stage Nash equilibrium. This allows the domestic firm to earn higher profit net of the subsidy. In essence the government perceives an advantage from introducing an earlier stage of pre-commitment. The government commits itself to lowering the cost of pre-commitment by domestic firms.
It is simply not credible for the firm to do this by itself. For example, just as a firm cannot deter entry by threatening to produce a large output should entry occur, it is not credible for the firm to pursuade other firms not to expand, by announcing that it is subsidizing, in some sense, its own $\mathrm{R} \& \mathrm{D}$. Without an actual subsidy, this is not profit maximizing behaviour given the level of costs and the nature of the equilibrium. On the other hand, the government is assumed able to offer a credible $\mathrm{R} \& \mathrm{D}$ subsidy, and can therefore influence the final equilibrium. ${ }^9$
